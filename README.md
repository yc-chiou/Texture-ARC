# Textured_Anti-Reflective-coating

## What is this project about?
This is solar cell research to understand patterned ARC impact on its efficiency. This study aims to understand the textured surface of ARC by using python-meep simulation tools. Users could specify the desired parameters(pattern sharp, width, depth, symmetry).

## Repository structure
- Six models of surface

## Run
- Download and Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
- Install pymeep: conda create -n mp -c conda-forge pymeep pymeep-extras, or with mpi: conda create -n pmp -c conda-forge pymeep=*=mpi_mpich_*
- Run jupyter notebook and run

## Experimental results
